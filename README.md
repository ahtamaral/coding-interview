Data structures to study:

[] Dynamic Array (and it's sorting algorithms)
    []
    []
    []
    []
[] Linked List
[] Stack
[] Deque
[] Binary Heap
[] Binomial Heap
[] Hashmap with open addressing
[] Hashmap with separate chaining
[] Binary search tree
[] AVL tree
[] Red-black tree
[] B-Tree
[] Disjoint set (Union find)
[] Graphs 



As i've been noticing, there are two types of study here: Exercise solving and data structure implementation.
